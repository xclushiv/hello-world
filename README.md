# hello-world

Hi everyone, 

My name is Shiv, I have zero knowledge about coding and that's what I'm here for, to learn and improve myself to be better in my classification.  
I would've never thought I would code in my life unless evolution of cyber security opened my eyes this past summer. Can't wait to get started.
